Information Security Risk Assessment & Incident Response

Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day Case Study (CVE-2025-61882)

-Overview
This project presents a real-world Information Security Risk Assessment and Incident Response based on the Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) zero-day vulnerability CVE-2025-61882, which was exploited in a large-scale data-theft and extortion campaign.
The work applies recognised cybersecurity frameworks to analyse how the attack occurred, what risks it created for organisations, and how those risks can be reduced through technical, operational and governance controls.

-Project Objectives
Identify and classify critical enterprise information assets
Analyse attacker Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
Assess risks using a structured likelihood × impact model
Map security controls to ISO 27001, NIST CSF, Cyber Essentials and COBIT
Propose prioritised, realistic mitigation strategies

-What This Project Demonstrates

This repository demonstrates practical skills in:
Threat modelling and attack analysis
Enterprise risk assessment
Incident response and breach evaluation
Security governance and compliance
Applying frameworks to real cyber incidents
It reflects how cybersecurity risks are analysed and managed in real organisations, not just in theory.

-Case Study
Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) – CVE-2025-61882
The vulnerability allowed unauthenticated remote code execution, leading to widespread data exfiltration and extortion. The project evaluates how organisations were compromised, why controls failed, and what should have been in place to prevent or limit the breach.
